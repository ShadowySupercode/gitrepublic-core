# GitRepublic Core

## What is `gitrepublic-core` ?

## Build
Adding executables and library output is simple. Add the concerned source and header files and link them to the executable.
Then execute the `build.sh` script. Like this:

    ./build.sh -t gitrepublic-core

To build all targets defined by the `CMakeLists.txt`, run the script without any special options:

    ./build.sh
